## 📊 The Digital Attention Crisis

In today's digital landscape, we face an unprecedented "attention crisis":

- Users spend ~1.5 hours daily on TikTok alone
- Average of 19 daily app opens
- 550+ hours annually consumed by short-form content
- 48% reduction in sustained focus
- 32% increase in anxiety and depression symptoms
- 27% drop in task completion rates

In reponse to this, BrainRot Master Vault aims revolutionize digital content consumption through intentional passive learning.
