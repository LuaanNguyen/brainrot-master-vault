## Goals for our app: 
- We use our app to create a productive podcast platform to replace doom scrolling
- Enable productive multitasking 
    - Can be comsumed via activities like: brushing your teeth, making dinner, or a short commute to work. Which are a lot of times overtaken by tiktok. 


## Terms: 
- "The Attention Economy"
- "Passive consumptions" 
- "productive multitasking"
- "Deep Over Shallow"

## Problem with TikTok 
TikTok's algorithm is specifically engineered to capture and maintain user attention through what psychologists describe as a "flow state" - a condition of intense concentration accompanied by a distorted sense of time. This design feature helps explain why many users find themselves scrolling for hours when they initially intended to spend just minutes on the app
- high entertainment value with minimal cognitive investment 
- Unpredictable viral contents 


The average TikTok user spends approximately 1.5 hours daily on the app, opening it roughly 19 times per day, which translates to about 550 hours annually that might otherwise be directed toward potentially more productive activities. This engagement pattern raises significant concerns about productivity impact.

TikTok's Challenge with Accuracy can be replaced by Podcast's Depth and Nuance (maybe use AI to add more valid contents)
